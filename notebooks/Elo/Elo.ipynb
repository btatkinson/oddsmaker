    "# Classic Elo\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic Elo algorithm is great for establishing a baseline for comparison of other methods. Due to its age and simplicity, it will almost certainly not be smarter than any liquid markets or more advanced algorithms. However, it is still fairly powerful. It shines when you have a lot of historical data and there are jumps in class. I.e., in college football, classic Elo will properly rate a strong group of five team even after they've played 10 easy opponents. In other words, it can store information about historically good conferences for a long time despite no interplay between conferences. Another example is in soccer when a newly promoted side enters a better division. Despite the promoted team having won 60%+ of their games the prior year, Elo will not project a gigantic winning percentage going forward against tougher competition. Elo also has the advantage that you do not need to know underlying distributions, only win/loss. Since most competitions have a winner and loser, it's very universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplicity\n",
    "- Computational speed\n",
    "- Universality\n",
    "- Ratings 'memory' - league heirarchies develop with enough data\n",
    "- Robust to param choices - a k between 10 and 30 will usually give you results that pass an eye test\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- No uncertainty. This causes problems when there are new players that you have no idea how good they are, or a player coming off extended absence\n",
    "- Cannot account for score difference. A win by 50 is the same as a win by 5.\n",
    "- There is no attempt to model style of play or player idiosyncracies\n",
    "- Constant K factor. Without some edits, it will not put more weight on certain games than others, i.e., if a team or player is particularly motivated. \n",
    "- As with any rating system, if players are allowed to selectively choose opponents, it can ruin the fidelity of the ratings\n",
    "- Is meant for 1v1 ratings, or team v team. Cannot innately handle 1vMany or Many vs. Many.\n",

It then takes two primary parameters, k value (how much to update the rankings) and home field advantage (optional). I have some sample men's basketball data below that I will use for demonstration. \n",
